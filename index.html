      <p><strong>Reducing Friction in Car Insurance Journey</strong><br>
      Redesigned the car insurance buying experience by focusing on small moments that frustrate customers most. While A/B testing played a part, the greater impact came from working closely with developers to optimise backend error handling. This simplified the experience, reduced drop-offs, and made the process faster and more reliable.</p>

<!-- Strategy Section -->
<section id="strategy" class="py-16 px-4 bg-[var(--offwhite)]">
  <div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto">
    <h1 class="text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-center text-[var(--primary)] mt-2 mb-10">Strategy.</h1>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12">
      <div>
        <p class="mb-6">Strategy, to me, is about creating focus. It’s how I help teams navigate ambiguity and move with purpose. I don’t think of it as something that happens once a quarter in a slide deck, it’s something that shows up every day in how we prioritise, how we say no, and how we stay aligned.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">I’m drawn to strategy because I like connecting the dots — between what users need, where the business wants to go, and what we’re actually capable of building.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">We’re in the business of being agile, which is why strategy needs to stay fluid. One quote I’ve always come back to is, “Plans are of little importance, but planning is everything.” To me, strategy isn’t about locking in a path — it’s about creating space to adapt while still moving with intent.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mb-6"><strong>Competitive & Market Analysis</strong><br>
        Understanding the market landscape helps shape smarter bets. I’ve regularly benchmarked competitors, tracked emerging trends, and mapped them against user needs to uncover white space. It’s a habit that keeps my thinking sharp and ensures strategic boulders stay relevant and well-informed.</p>
        <p class="mb-6"><strong>Roadmapping</strong><br>
        This is the bread and butter. Roadmaps have been my go-to tool for aligning with leadership, setting direction, and giving teams clarity. I focus on sequencing work around value and leadership priorities, creating just enough structure for teams to stay coordinated without losing flexibility.</p>
        <p class="mb-6"><strong>Opportunity Mapping & Problem Framing</strong><br>
        Every feature should start with a problem worth solving. I use research, data, and insight synthesis to frame problems clearly, then explore paths forward using tools like opportunity solution trees. It’s how I keep discovery focused, grounded, and actionable.</p>
        <p><strong>Initiative Briefs</strong><br>
        Sometimes leadership just wants a clear answer to “why this, and why now?” I write initiative briefs that lay out the opportunity, context, and intended outcomes — backed by both qualitative insights and hard data. They’ve become a helpful way to drive alignment and make confident, well-informed decisions.</p>

<!-- Execution Section -->
<section id="execution" class="max-w-6xl mx-auto py-16 px-4">
  <h1 class="text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-center text-[var(--primary)] mt-2 mb-10">Execution.</h1>
  <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12">
    <div>
      <p class="mb-6">Execution is where the pen meets the paper. For me, it’s about maintaining momentum without losing sight of the details. I’ve always taken pride in making sure that great ideas actually ship.</p>
      <p class="mb-6">I stay close to the work, not because I don’t trust the team, but so I can support them where it counts and help keep things moving. That might mean unblocking a decision, clarifying scope, or making a call when it’s needed.</p>
      <p class="mb-6">Getting something out even a day sooner means more value in the hands of users. And starting the next thing one day earlier than our competitors is part of how we stay ahead.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Clarify unknowns</strong><br>
      Execution depends on clarity. Before we build anything, I work closely with engineers and designers to reduce uncertainty. That means writing acceptance criteria, chasing sign-offs, reviewing designs, and making sure everyone has what they need to move forward. It’s not glamorous, but it’s essential. When the upfront work is solid, delivery runs smoother.</p>
      <p class="mb-6"><strong>Prioritisation</strong><br>
      Prioritisation is one of the most constant and invisible parts of execution. I use tools like MoSCoW, RICE, and the effort-impact matrix to help guide those conversations, but real prioritisation is about understanding risk, sequencing, and timing. I focus on one core question: what delivers the most value with the least effort, right now?</p>
      <p><strong>Delivery Management</strong><br>
      Every team delivers a little differently, so I adapt the process to fit the context. Most of my work has been in Agile environments, but I’ve used elements of Waterfall and XP when needed. I help teams establish a steady working rhythm by running cadences, setting clear goals, tracking progress, surfacing blockers early, and making sure delivery stays aligned to value without becoming rigid.</p>

<!-- Insight Section -->
<section id="insight" class="py-16 px-4 bg-[var(--offwhite)] text-gray-900">
  <div class="max-w-6xl mx-auto">
    <h1 class="text-5xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-center text-[var(--primary)] mt-2 mb-10">Insight.</h1>
    <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-12">
      <div>
        <p class="mb-6">Good decisions start with understanding. I rely on insight to connect what users are doing with why they’re doing it.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Insight is a continuous act of understanding user behaviour well enough to guide decisions. That means speaking with users, unpacking data, and generating hypotheses the team can act on.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">Insights help me reduce risk, shape better bets, and make sure that what we’re building will actually matter to users.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p class="mb-6"><strong>User Research</strong><br>
        Talking to users is one of the most valuable things I do as a product manager. I regularly reach out to understand their needs, motivations, and pain points — not just what they say, but how they behave.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">These conversations can take many forms: interviews, usability sessions, or hypothesis testing. Each one helps me validate assumptions, spot friction points, and work with design and engineering to turn those insights into clear, actionable decisions.</p>
        <p class="mb-6"><strong>Data Analysis</strong><br>
        Data gives me another perspective on user behaviour, it shows what’s actually happening, even when no one’s talking about it.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">I use data to understand how features are being adopted, where users drop off, and where opportunities might be hiding.</p>
        <p class="mb-6">That might mean reviewing funnels, tracking user paths, designing surveys, or watching key product metrics over time. Without data, we’re just guessing. With it, we’re learning as we go.</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback Loops</strong><br>
        It’s easy to assume we know what users think, but I prefer to ask and listen regularly. I’ve set up feedback channels like in-app surveys, NPS, and structured check-ins with support and success teams to make sure we’re hearing directly from users.</p>
        <p>Sometimes a single piece of feedback reveals something we missed. These loops help surface patterns early and give the team real context behind what we’re building.</p>
